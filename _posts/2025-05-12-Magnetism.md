## Intro:

Magnetism is a fundamental force of nature that arises from the motion of electric charges. It is responsible for the attraction and repulsion between magnetic materials, as well as the behavior of magnetic fields. This force can be quantified using flux density which tells us how strong the magnetic field is in a given area. 

The permeability of a material is a measure of how easily it can be magnetized, and it plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic properties of materials. Ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, cobalt, and nickel, have high permeability and can be easily magnetized. They exhibit a phenomenon called hysteresis, which means that their magnetization depends on their history of exposure to magnetic fields. Understanding these concepts is essential for applications in electrical engineering and electronics, where magnetic materials are used in transformers, inductors, and various other devices.

This presentation will explore the concepts of permeability and ferromagnetic materials, delving into their properties, behavior, and applications in the field of magnetism. We will also discuss the hysteresis loop and how it relates to the magnetization of ferromagnetic materials. By the end of this presentation, you will have a deeper understanding of these fundamental concepts in magnetism and their significance in engineering and technology.
