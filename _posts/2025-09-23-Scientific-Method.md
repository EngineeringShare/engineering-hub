## Intro:

The scientific method is a systematic approach used by scientists and researchers to investigate natural phenomena, acquire new knowledge, or correct and integrate previous knowledge. It involves a series of steps that help ensure the reliability and validity of scientific findings. The key steps of the scientific method include: 
1. **Observation**: Noticing and describing a phenomenon or group of phenomena.
2. **Question**: Formulating a question based on the observation.
3. **Hypothesis**: Proposing a tentative explanation or prediction that can be tested.
4. **Prediction**: Making specific predictions based on the hypothesis.
5. **Experiment**: Designing and conducting experiments to test the predictions.
6. **Conclusion**: Drawing conclusions based on the analysis and determining the next steps, which may include further testing or refinement of the hypothesis.
7. **Iteration**: Repeating the process to refine and expand understanding.
The scientific method is fundamental to scientific inquiry and helps ensure that conclusions are based on empirical evidence and logical reasoning. This page explores each step in detail, providing examples and highlighting the importance of critical thinking and skepticism in scientific research.
