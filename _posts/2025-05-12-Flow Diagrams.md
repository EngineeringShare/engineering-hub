## Intro:

Flowcharts are a visual method of representing how a program or system operates, bridging the gap between plain English and code. They use standardized symbols to show processes, decisions, inputs, and outputs, making it easier to plan and communicate logic before programming begins. This presentation explores the key flowchart symbols, how to use them effectively, and common mistakes to avoid, providing a foundation for designing clear and structured control logic.
