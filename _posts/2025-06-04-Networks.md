## Intro:

Networks are systems that connect multiple devices or nodes to facilitate communication and data exchange. They can be classified based on their topology, which refers to the arrangement of the nodes and the connections between them. Common network topologies include star, ring, bus, and mesh, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of performance, reliability, and scalability. Additionally, networks can utilize various communication standards and protocols to ensure effective data transmission. Two widely used standards are RS-232 and RS-485, which define the electrical characteristics and timing for serial communication between devices. This page explores the different types of network topologies and the key features of RS-232 and RS-485 standards, highlighting their applications in industrial and commercial settings.
