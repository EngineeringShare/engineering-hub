## Intro:

Chemicals are substances that consist of matter and have a specific composition and properties. They can be classified into elements, compounds, mixtures, solutions, molecules, salts, suspensions, and more. Elements are pure substances made up of only one type of atom, while compounds are formed when two or more different elements chemically combine. Mixtures consist of two or more substances that are physically combined but not chemically bonded. Solutions are homogeneous mixtures where one substance is dissolved in another. Molecules are the smallest units of a compound that retain its chemical properties. Salts are ionic compounds formed from the reaction of an acid and a base. Saturation refers to the point at which a solution can no longer dissolve additional solute. Suspensions are heterogeneous mixtures where solid particles are dispersed in a liquid but do not dissolve. Understanding these different types of chemicals and their properties is essential for studying chemistry and its applications in various fields. The presentation below explores the key concepts related to chemicals, including their classifications, properties, and interactions.
