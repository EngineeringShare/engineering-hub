## Intro:

Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between that of conductors and insulators. They are essential in modern electronics, particularly in devices like diodes and transistors. This presentation explores the fundamental concepts of semiconductors, including the distinction between n-type and p-type materials, which are created through a process called doping. Doping involves adding impurities to pure semiconductor materials to alter their electrical properties. The band gap, a key characteristic of semiconductors, defines the energy difference between the valence band and the conduction band, influencing how electrons move within the material. Understanding these principles is crucial for grasping how semiconductor devices function and their applications in electronic circuits.
