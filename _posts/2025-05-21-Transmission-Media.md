## Intro:

Transmission media are the physical pathways through which data is transmitted from one device to another in a communication system. They can be broadly categorized into wired and wireless media. Wired transmission media include various types of cables such as twisted pair cables, coaxial cables, and fiber optic cables, each with its own characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Twisted pair cables are commonly used for telephone and Ethernet connections, while coaxial cables are often used for cable television and internet services. Fiber optic cables, on the other hand, use light to transmit data and offer high bandwidth and long-distance capabilities. This page explores the different types of transmission media, their properties, and their applications in modern communication systems.
