## Intro:

Flux density (B) and field strength (H) are fundamental concepts in electromagnetism that describe the behavior of magnetic fields. Flux density, measured in teslas (T), represents the amount of magnetic flux passing through a unit area perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. It indicates the strength and concentration of the magnetic field in a given region. Field strength, measured in amperes per meter (A/m), quantifies the intensity of the magnetic field generated by electric currents or magnetic materials. The motor effect refers to the phenomenon where a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force, which is the principle behind electric motors. This page explores the concepts of flux density, field strength, and the motor effect, highlighting their significance in various applications such as electric motors, transformers, and electromagnetic devices.
