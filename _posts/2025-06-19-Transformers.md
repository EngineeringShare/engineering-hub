## Intro:

Transformers are electrical devices that transfer electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction. They are commonly used to increase (step-up) or decrease (step-down) voltage levels in power distribution systems, allowing for efficient transmission of electricity over long distances and safe usage in homes and businesses. Transformers consist of primary and secondary coils wound around a magnetic core, and they operate on the principle of Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which states that a change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor. This page explores the basic principles, construction, and applications of transformers in various electrical and electronic systems.
