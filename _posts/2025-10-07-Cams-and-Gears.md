## Intro:

Cams and gears are fundamental mechanical components used in various machines and devices to transmit motion and force. 
Cams are rotating or sliding pieces that convert rotary motion into linear motion, often used in engines and automated machinery. They come in different profiles, such as eccentric, pear-shaped, and heart-shaped, each designed to achieve specific motion characteristics. Followers are the components that interact with cams, translating the cam's motion into the desired output.
Gears, on the other hand, are toothed wheels that mesh together to transmit torque and rotational motion between shafts. Common types of gears include spur gears, bevel gears, and worm gears, each suited for different applications based on their design and the direction of force transmission. Understanding gear ratios is crucial for determining the mechanical advantage and speed of the output shaft relative to the input shaft. This page explores the principles of cams and gears, their types, functions, and applications in mechanical systems.
