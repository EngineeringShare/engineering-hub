## Intro:

Permeability is a measure of how easily a material can support the formation of a magnetic field within itself. It is a fundamental property that indicates the ability of a material to conduct magnetic lines of force. Materials with high permeability, such as ferromagnetic materials like iron, cobalt, and nickel, can become strongly magnetized when exposed to an external magnetic field. Ferromagnetic materials exhibit unique characteristics, including hysteresis, which is the lag between changes in magnetization and the external magnetic field. This page explores the concept of permeability, the properties of ferromagnetic materials, and their applications in various industries, including electrical engineering and electronics.
